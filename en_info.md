This educational app explores data from ***David J Nutt et al 2010 [ research paper](https://www.drugscience.org.uk/drug-harms-in-the-uk/)*** that assess the various harms of drugs used recreationally in the UK using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) – a method that uses relevant experts’ knowledge and experience to assess the actual and relative harms.

The paper and the dataset can be found [here](https://drugscience.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/MCDA_Lancet_1-11-10.pdf) and in the link above.

This is intended to be a didactical tool to fuel the discussion on the flaws of the current drug harm classification. The MCDA model presents an improved and more sensitiv harm categorization but also introduces conceptual challenges in matters of Drug Policy. To learn more about this discussion please refer to the [commentary of Stephen Rolles and Fiona Measham](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0955395911000582?via%3Dihub) questioning the method and utility of ranking drug harms in drug policy.
